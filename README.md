## Detecting nmap scans and bruteforce attempts
This project simulates detecting nmap scan, and ssh bruteforce using wazuh and suricata.
## Tools Used
- Wazuh agent and manager
- Suricata
- Hydra
- Ubuntu server
- Kali linux
## Steps Performed
- Setup suricata
- Setup Wazuh agent and manager
- Launched a nmap scan and detected it using Wazuh manager.
- Found that port 22 ssh is open in target system.
- Lauched a bruteforce attack against ssh.
- Detected the attack.
